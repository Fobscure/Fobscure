# Hi, I'm Sara ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I'm a curious student interested in AI, Psychoanalysis and Data Analysis. Over time, I've found myself drawn to thinkers like **Ludwig Wittgenstein** and **Jacques Lacan**. Although their work has faced many criticisms and reveals certain limitations, I find both their ideas and the debates around them inspiring and intellectually provocative.(Yes, Pun intended!)
My goal is to let my intuition lead and gain a clearer understanding of the world around me through the lens of analysis, statistics, languages.

## What Inspires Me

- **Psychoanalysis & Philosophy:** Exploring the foundations of human thought, emotion, behavior and everything lying in The Unconsciousness
- **Logic & Linguistics:** Delving into how formal systems can illuminate both natural and artificial languages, how AI can interact with human beings through languages, I FEED ON COMPLEX SYSTEMS.
