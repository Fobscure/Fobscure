# Hi, I'm Sara ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I love everything about LANGUAGE, PSYCHOANALYSIS, and whatever hidden behind symbols, be it digits or words. Recently I got curious about **Ludwig Wittgenstein** and **Jacques Lacan** theories. Although their work has faced many criticisms and reveals certain limitations, I find both their ideas and the debates around them inspiring and provocative.(Yes, Pun intended!)
My goal is to let my intuition lead and gain a clearer understanding of the world around me through the lens of analysis, statistics, languages. 

## What Inspires Me

- **Psychoanalysis & Philosophy:** Understanding human thought, emotion, behavior and everything lying in The Unconsciousness
- **Logic & Linguistics:** Delving into how formal systems can illuminate both natural and artificial languages, how AI can interact with human beings through languages.
